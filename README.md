# RESTREX
Retzbach Strontium Examinator


This is the GitHub page for the RESTREX (Retzbach Strontium Examinator) Code written for my master thesis at the IUP in 2022 und the supervision of Prof. Dr. Norbert Frank. This coding prject is composed of two procedural evaluation scripts written in Python:
- RESTREX to evaluate the results from the Thermo Fisher Neptune MC-ICP-MS
- RESTREX-Chemistry to evaluate concentration measurements from the Thermo Fisher iCAP Q ICP-MS

To run the scripts, one has to extract the contents of RESTREX_Starterkit.zip onto the Desktop and open the .py files with a Python IDE of choice. I recommend Spyder. They should be able to run without any changes with the provided example data (given that Python's home directory is the user directory). If this first-run is successfull, try adjusting the parameters of the main functions at the end of the script to your needs.

To understand how the scripts work, the user is referred to the documentation in the code as well as the guide document in this repository. The corresponding master thesis can be requested from Prof. Frank:
